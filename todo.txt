- nostr

    - CRITICAL
        - i18n does not work ?!
        - good links to simplex & matrix groups depending on bitblik or test.bitblik
        - on invalidBlik and cancel by taker we should cancel the reservation and go back to funded
        - list of default accepted coordinator's npubs in client, overridable by env vars for test.bitblik.app

    - NICE TO HAVE
        - retry to subscribe in nostr service for KIND_COORDINATOR_REQUEST (client requests) onError
        - offer details screen linkable by https://bitblik.app/#/offer/<id>
        - in progress offers should be listed in offer list with that in progress, timer
        - if maker confirms during conflict (made mistake) the taker conflict screen should listen to such status and show process paying screen
        - add custom coordinator by npub (store in client preferences)
        - past/finished/history offers for given neko
        - relays for coordinator fetched from nip-65
            - if non existent and configured in .env broadcast nip-65 event with relay list
        - remove circular dependency between coordinator/nostr services !!
        - use ndk.accounts instead of single signer (multiple nekos)
        - fix the tests for nostr service not available

- NWC wallet integration
    - ndk.wallets (NWC) from leo's branch

- settle maker invoice after 1 hour even if not confirmed so that we can resolve conflict having the sats
- fidelity bond for taker
- check leaking details on api json
- while in /taker-conflict if maker confirms it should refresh and show taker success

- better details on MakerSuccessScreen
- save the failed payment reason (could not get an invoice from lnurl/ no route /??) and show it on takerFailedPayment screen

- timer countdown of 2min for validity of blik code in both taker/maker screens with info what to do next.
- in taker screen show when maker received blik ( blikReceived -> blikSentToMaker)

- sound effects when status changes
- local notifications when status changes
- telegram bot

======
- dark theme

======
- extract common code between coordinator & client (offer model)
- coordinator /admin/* for admin actions on allowed pubkeys
- stats like https://plebqr.com/ for coordinator
- why it doesn't work well on mobile browsers (vanadium, ironfox) -> https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/remote-debugging

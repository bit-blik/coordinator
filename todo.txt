- nostr

    - CRITICAL
        - on invalidBlik and cancel by taker we should cancel the reservation and go back to funded
        - [ ] accept terms of service per coordinator
        - if a client took and reserved an offer but then canceled reservation, and then another client took it, I have resume!!!

    RELEASE:
        - adjust  <data android:scheme="https" android:host="test.bitblik.app" android:pathPrefix="/" /> to bitblik.app
        - FRONTEND_DOMAIN: test.bitblik.app

    - NICE TO HAVE

        - offer details screen should subscribe to offer status change and update status in UI
          - and show timers (reserved time left, blik code validity time left)
          - this is needed when it's not a get_my_active_offer, since status updates it's only for active per key
        - good links to simplex & matrix groups depending on bitblik or test.bitblik
        - coordinator metadata kind-0
            - name
            - avatar picture
            - relays (nip-65)
        - coordinator discovery on bootstrap many relays (purplepag.es)
        - whitelist coordinators:
            - from bitblik followed list
            - list of default accepted coordinator's npubs in client, overridable by env vars for test.bitblik.app

        - timer 120s on /confirm-blik and after inform of 48h (?) it will automatically be settled in taker's favor
        - retry to subscribe in nostr service for KIND_COORDINATOR_REQUEST (client requests) onError
        - in progress offers should be listed in offer list with that in progress, timer
        - if maker confirms during conflict (made mistake) the taker conflict screen should listen to such status and show process paying screen
        - add custom coordinator by npub (store in client preferences)
        - past/finished/history offers for given neko
        - relays for coordinator fetched from nip-65
            - if non existent and configured in .env broadcast nip-65 event with relay list
        - remove circular dependency between coordinator/nostr services !!
        - use ndk.accounts instead of single signer (multiple nekos)
        - fix the tests for nostr service not available
        - public stats / coordinator info should not require client pubkey (rpc signing request)

- NWC wallet integration
    - ndk.wallets (NWC) from leo's branch

- settle maker invoice after 1 hour even if not confirmed so that we can resolve conflict having the sats
- fidelity bond for taker
- check leaking details on api json
- while in /taker-conflict if maker confirms it should refresh and show taker success

- better details on MakerSuccessScreen
- save the failed payment reason (could not get an invoice from lnurl/ no route /??) and show it on takerFailedPayment screen

- timer countdown of 2min for validity of blik code in both taker/maker screens with info what to do next.
- in taker screen show when maker received blik ( blikReceived -> blikSentToMaker)

- sound effects when status changes
- local notifications when status changes

======
- dark theme

======
- extract common code between coordinator & client (offer model)
- coordinator /admin/* for admin actions on allowed pubkeys
- stats like https://plebqr.com/ for coordinator

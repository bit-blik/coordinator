- suggestions
    - more info about exchange rate sources (average)
    - wyslij blik nie na czerwone?
    - missing clock progress in make confirm blik (2min)
    - show BLIK in success screen??

- nostr

    - test invalid invoice for taker to be paid and screen to enter new invoice
    - taker design -+
    - going back to a blikReceived status for the maker doesn't fetch the blik code
        - worst, if we cancel on the maker it will disappear from the maker client !??!!
            - it changed status to cancelled in the DB!?!? why, should not be possible from blikReceived
            - why does cancelled is returned as active offer in get_my_active_offer ???

    - handle reservation / cancel near offer expiration time to avoid reseting to funded
        and fucking up the state diagram dependencies, specially when in conflict/dispute states.

    RELEASE:
        - fix matrix login!
        - change everywhere new logo
            - simplex group
            - matrix element group
        - zapstore publish
        - github release
        - deploy client web on bitblik.app

    - NEXT

        - timer when waiting for taker is calculated from created_at offer which is not at the time the offer was saved in DB but when created in client UI
            - should be fixed now that nip69 created_at is not used anymore, to confirm!

        - expired offer is as active but cannot do anything with it (cannot resume offer in state...)
        - offers from custom coordinators should still show coordinator info on offer details screen
        - review terms of usage
        - info + checkbox risk of refund BLIK acceptance
        - should confirm offer data from coordinator and not only rely on nostr KIND_OFFER event, for offer list and details
        - offer details screen should subscribe to offer status change and update status in UI
          - and show timers (reserved time left, blik code validity time left)
          - this is needed when it's not a get_my_active_offer, since status updates it's only for active per key
        - on invalidBlik status, it should be possible to cancel which would also cancel the reservation and go back to funded
            - needs support code in coordinator workflow
        - coordinator metadata kind-0
            - name
            - avatar picture
            - relays (nip-65)
        - coordinator discovery on bootstrap many relays (purplepag.es)
        - whitelist coordinators:
            - from bitblik followed list
            - list of default accepted coordinator's npubs in client, overridable by env vars for test.bitblik.app

        - timer 120s on /confirm-blik and after inform of 48h (?) it will automatically be settled in taker's favor
        - retry to subscribe in nostr service for KIND_COORDINATOR_REQUEST (client requests) onError
        - in progress offers should be listed in offer list with that in progress, timer
        - if maker confirms during conflict (made mistake) the taker conflict screen should listen to such status and show process paying screen
        - add custom coordinator by npub (store in client preferences)
        - past/finished/history offers for given neko
        - relays for coordinator fetched from nip-65
            - if non existent and configured in .env broadcast nip-65 event with relay list
        - remove circular dependency between coordinator/nostr services !!
        - use ndk.accounts instead of single signer (multiple nekos)
        - fix the tests for nostr service not available
        - public stats / coordinator info should not require client pubkey (rpc signing request)

- list of current/finished offers in menu
- rate coordinators on nostr (find which NIP for ratings)
- premium % above market price for maker
- NWC wallet integration
    - ndk.wallets (NWC) from leo's branch

- reputation mode (maybe using nostr profiles and WoT?)

- notifications
    - by nostr
    - by foreground service

- settle maker invoice after 1 hour even if not confirmed so that we can resolve conflict having the sats
- fidelity bond for taker
- while in /taker-conflict if maker confirms it should refresh and show taker success

- better details on MakerSuccessScreen
- save the failed payment reason (could not get an invoice from lnurl/ no route /??) and show it on takerFailedPayment screen

- timer countdown of 2min for validity of blik code in both taker/maker screens with info what to do next.
- in taker screen show when maker received blik ( blikReceived -> blikSentToMaker)

- sound effects when status changes
- local notifications when status changes

- dark theme

======
- extract common code between coordinator & client (offer model)
- coordinator /admin/* for admin actions on allowed pubkeys
- stats like https://plebqr.com/ for coordinator
